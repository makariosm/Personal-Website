# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This space is where I share my journey, experiences, and projects. Whether you’re here to learn more about my work, my hobbies, or just to say hello, I’m glad you stopped by.

## About Me
I’m Makarios Mansour, an aspiring software engineer and robotics enthusiast. I’m currently working on a hazzat generator for different coptic hymns.  

In my spare time, you can find me skiing, playing soccer, or doing robotics competitions.

## Projects
Here, I’ll showcase some of the projects I’m currently working on or have worked on in the past. Feel free to check them out:

- **Reversi**: A fun, interactive game! The aim of the game is to capture more discs than your opponent. There are options for grid types as well as single-player and two-player modes.
- **Klondike**: A spin-off of the classic Solitaire game! For the default game-mode the same rules apply as for normal Solitaire. However, there are other versions of the game available with different sets of rules.
- **This Personal Website**: This is the source code for my personal website

## Get in Touch
Feel free to reach out to me. I’m always open to new opportunities, collaborations, or just a friendly chat!
